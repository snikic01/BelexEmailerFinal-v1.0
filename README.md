# belexDataEmailer - packaged final version (v2)\n\nThis package includes the fix you asked for:\n- Robust prices.json handling (file will be created if missing, backed up if corrupt)\n- The code now expects you to provide the exact CSS selector of the price element on the Belex page via PRICE_SELECTOR in .env. This will give accurate prices instead of guessing from page text.\n\nFiles included:\n- server.merged.js\n- Functions/functions.improved.js (updated)\n- package.json\n- .env.example\n- README.md\n\nFollow the same Quick Start instructions as before (open in VS Code, install deps, set .env, npm start).
